# snake-the-game

### My attempt at recreating the classic retro game **SNAKE** 🐍 in vanilla JS!

--- 

#### Features to be included:
✅ Control a snake using the keyboard.
- [ ] Game ends if snake touches itself.
✅ Touching “food” makes snake grow longer/score go up.

#### Stretch goals: 
- [ ] Save scores in localStorage to show best attempts.
✅ Speed game up as score gets higher.

#### Learning outcomes: 
- [ ] Keyboard event handlers
- [ ] Managing complex game state
- [ ] Collision detection
