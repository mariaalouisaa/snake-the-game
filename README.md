# snake-the-game

### My attempt at recreating the classic retro game **SNAKE** 🐍 in vanilla JS!

*Almost entirely made with the `canvas` element*.

--- 

### Features include:
- 🐍 `eventListners` to enable the use of the keyboard
- 🍎 JS collision detection to make the snake grow longer & for game over 
- 🌟 High score saved to `localStorage`
- ⚡ Game speend increases as the score gets higher with aid of `setTimeout`
- 🎵 `audio` implemented for maximum user experience
- 🔕 Button with the functionality to toggle `.mute`ing the page
- 🕹️ Personalised favicon for the page



**Main learning outcomes => working with canvas and managing a complex game state.**

---

### Still to do: 
- [ ] Game ends if snake touches itself.
- [ ] Research resposive design for canvas & unit testing for canvas

*Please see issue for more information.*

#### Screenshots of project coming soon!
