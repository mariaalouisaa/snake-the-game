# 🐍 snake-the-game

### My attempt at recreating the classic retro game **SNAKE** in vanilla JS!

⚠️ Hit the wall or the snake itself and it's game over! How high of a score can you get?!

*Almost entirely made with the `canvas` element*.

--- 

### Features include:
- 🐍 `eventListners` to enable the use of the keyboard
- 🍎 JS collision detection to make the snake grow longer & for game over 
- 🌟 High score saved to `localStorage`
- ⚡ Game speend increases as the score gets higher with aid of `setTimeout`
- 🎵 `audio` implemented for maximum user experience
- 🔕 Button with the functionality to toggle `.mute`ing the page
- 🕹️ Personalised favicon for the page
- 🎨 `flexbox` and CSS `transitions`



**Main learning outcomes => working with canvas and managing a complex game state.**

**Notes on the `<canvas>` element and accessability:**

Canvas content is not exposed to accessibility tools as semantic HTML is. In general, you should avoid using canvas in an accessible website or app. More info availble on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas).

### Still to do: 
- [ ] Research resposive design for canvas & unit testing for canvas
